## 🧱 How It Works – Full System Workflow

### 🔁 1. Transaction Input
- User enters dummy card info via frontend (card number, amount, receiver)
- Frontend sends request to Go backend: `/api/transactions`

### 🧾 2. Transaction Recording
- Backend maps card → user
- Checks internal balance (PostgreSQL)
- Records debit + credit entries (double-entry ledger)
- Saves transaction row
- Publishes event to Kafka: `transaction_topic`

### 🔎 3. Fraud Detection + Scoring
- Python service subscribes to `transaction_topic`
- Predicts fraud score via XGBoost model
- Generates SHAP explanation (e.g. unusual location, large amount, past behavior)
- Flags txns with score > 0.85, saves to `fraud_flags`
- Publishes event to `fraud_flagged_topic`

### 📜 4. OPA Compliance Enforcement
- Policy engine receives transaction payload
- Applies Rego rules: geo-blocks, limits, KYC check
- If violation: txn is rejected + saved in `policy_violations`

### 🤖 5. GPT-4 Audit Generation
- GPT receives SHAP + fraud context + policy info
- Generates natural language explanation  
  _Example:_  
  > "This transaction was flagged for $6,500 at 3 AM in a country not previously visited by the user."
- GPT module generates:
  - Audit logs (stored)
  - Risk profile summaries (per user)
  - Red-team adversarial test cases

### 📊 6. Dashboard Visualization (Admin Panel)
- Frontend fetches:
  - Transaction history
  - Live fraud flags
  - GPT summaries
  - Compliance violations
- Displays:
  - Risk dashboards
  - User risk scores
  - Interactive visualizations (Chart.js, D3)
  - Exportable logs (PDF/CSV)

### 🧠 7. AI Personal Finance Assistant
- Tracks categories: food, travel, entertainment, savings
- GPT-4 gives:
  - Budget tips
  - Expense insights
  - Smart savings goals

### 💬 8. Banking Chatbot (Dialogflow + GPT-4)
- Users can ask:
  - “What’s my current balance?”
  - “Was my card used in Canada?”
  - “How can I improve savings?”
- If unsupported, fallback to GPT-4

### 🔐 9. Security Layer
- JWT-authenticated API calls
- Keycloak for SSO + admin roles
- Vault manages secrets (OpenAI, DB, TLS keys)
- TLS encryption across backend services

### 📈 10. Observability Stack
- Prometheus: collects metrics (txns/min, fraud rate, GPT latency)
- Grafana: dashboards (fraud spike, top users, performance)
- Jaeger: full trace of request from API → Fraud → GPT → DB
- ELK (Kibana): search logs per user, txn ID, or fraud type

### ☁️ 11. Infrastructure & CI/CD
- Docker containers per service
- Kubernetes orchestrates scaling, health, restarts
- GitHub Actions auto-build and deploy branches
- ArgoCD (optional): GitOps-based continuous delivery
- Terraform or Pulumi: Cloud setup (DB, cluster, secrets)
